Project management is the nervous system of an engineering organization. It
lies between the executive system and 
Competent project management interfaces the high level instructions from the 
brain, the executive team, to the details of the body. strong engineering organization has two legs: engineering and project
management. The balance and collaboration of the legs is vital for moving the
organization in the proper direction. In balances lead to awkward movement
which wastes resources and looses races.


The iron triangle of project management is a model for understanding the
trade-offs and constraints which can be applied. It states that a project's
quality is governed by 3 constraints: scope (features), monetary cost, and
schedule. 

Business constraints play a large role, however indirect, in all engineering
teams. Generally, all engineering activities serve a larger business goal, but
often goals conflict
that are provided by the customers and business which
govern project management. The relationships between the controllable factors
is often complex in detail, but 


Any strong engineering company has a healthy balance between raw engineering
talent and project management. TenResponsible for delivering embedded software, your team like all others
is subject to the **insert link to ref below**[Iron Triangle of Project 
Management]. The principle was originally defined to state that a project's 
quality is governed by 3 constraints: scope, cost, and time, but because the 
figure is a triangle, quality, the 4th factor, is often forgotten. Instead, a 
project should be viewed as an equation which governs the relationships between 
4 factors. In this representation, it is clear that changes to one factor 
will propagate to the other factors. Factors can be prioritized by being held
constant (ie made a constraint), but not all factors can be held constant. The
error in project planning must be able to manifest itself in one of the 
factors. For example, if a piece of software with these specific features, 
**scope**, must be deliverable on September 15th, **date**, and your team has 
3 full-time developers, **cost**, then the software's quality will be 
determined by the degree of error in project management. How accurate was
project management at predicting the relationships of these factors? 

NOTE: Its important to understand that this model is an imperfect
simplification. For example, a project 

Although embedded software teams should work closely with project management to
decide how the factors should be prioritized and changed, a team working in a
strictly software-producing capacity is really only in control of quality and
cost. The interplay between these factors is based on how a team spends its
time. 

As an embedded software team, working in
a striclty software devleopment capacity meaning you are not advising project
managment how it can manipulate the constraints.

== Flaws of the Iron Triangle
* A special case can occur when adding indirect scope (ie tooling, automation, 
  process standardization, process execution, meetings, etc.) Even though scope
  increases, quality increases and cost and time decreases all simultaneously.
  This violates the central principle of the iron triangle: "Quality, scope, 
  cost, and time. Choose 3."
** REBUTTAL: perhaps some indirect scope actually decreases the total scope.

NOTE: Business' operational expenses are explicitly not included because
they vary greatly depending on the organization. For example, the total profit
of a single product company must be large enough to bankroll HR, management,
customer service, etc., but at a multi-product company, the relationship is
less clear.
